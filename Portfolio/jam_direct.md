I worked at Jam Direct in a 4 month co-op position as a full stack developer. During that time I was fortunate to experience working with multiple teams and people from different departments. I was also assigned to an independent project that involved developing a critical component of emails that were sent to tens of thousands of Canadians, using Python and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Working in multiple teams and on different projects, I had to quickly adapt and manage my time, so I could complete everything on time. Having worked in multiple projects, it required me to have a strong foundation in multiple aspects of programming, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Python, AWS, Git, and SQL. The time I spent at Jam Direct was definitely some of the funnest times I have had programming and I would highly recommend it for future students to apply for their coop program.
