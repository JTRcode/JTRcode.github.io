At the end of my CSCC10 Human-Computer Interactions course, the best teams were given the special opportunity to present their ideas and UX designs to a panel of judges that consisted of IBM’s UX Design Group including Karel Vredenburg, IBM’s Director of Global Design Leadership & Academic Programs. Our group designed a reminiscent app that focuses on seniors with depression and dementia. The most challenging part of the process was trying to design an app that was simple enough for seniors to use. In order to ensure that was the case, we performed multiple paper prototypes, cognitive walkthroughs, heuristic evaluations, SUS surveys, and applied the NPS method. Our team consisted of Laila Tawfik, Daniela Venturo, Nyah Way, Wilson Mak, Yousuf Madi, and myself.
