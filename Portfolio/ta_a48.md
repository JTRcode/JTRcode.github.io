I have been a TA for both CSCA08 Introduction to Computer Science and CSCA48 Introduction to Computer Science II. As a TA, I ran tutorials and office hours to ensure students understand the materials and to enforce the important topics of each week. Being a TA is an amazing experience and is a sign of approval from the professors of your skills.
