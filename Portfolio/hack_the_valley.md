I'm part of the organizing commitee for UTSC's student hackathon, Hack the Valley, starting in 2018.
It's one of largest Canada Hackathon with over 500 participants and growing. We are always trying to partner with more
sponsors and find more opportunites to improve our hacker's experience every year.

This year Hack the Valley 4 will be happening in February 2020. Follow us on facebook or here for when
we announce the opening of sign ups.
