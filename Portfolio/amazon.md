As an Amazon AWS Connect SDE Intern I got the opportunity to take on larger and more  production impactful roles. As the team was extremely small, I got to work on delivering new customer features that had delivery deadlines. As part of this project I experienced many aspects of what it’s like to be an actual Amazon SDE; communicating with other teams, onboarding different services, escalating tickets, coordinating with opsec, requesting and managing permission, and creating new service/ packages.

AWS Connect is a service Amazon offers for companies to efficiently setup and run their call centres. Through contact flows, customers can design how inbound and outbound calls navigate and when it’s necessary to connect a caller with an agent. For outbound calls, there is a module called Check Call Progress, this module uses ML to detect what we have reached on the other end of a call without needing an agent. My project involves saving these recordings including early media. This deals with sensitive customer data, so a lot of effort was placed into how to store, use this data, and that we had customer’s permission. Specifically I was responsible to checking we had customer permissions before saving the recordings as well as deleting past recordings of customers who have opted out.
