Bookie is an app designed to target book-lovers all over the world. It’s a platform modeled after traditional in-person book clubs, but now it’s offered virtually. Readers can find groups for books they are currently reading, and connect with other book lovers. Readers are able to share their opinions and ideas as they read through a book with others across the world.

It’s currently in the development process with co-founders and developers Nyah Way and myself Jackson Han. It will be offered as a cross platform app, made with Flutter and Firebase.
