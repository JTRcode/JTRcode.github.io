Covid-19 has hit a lot of restuarants with uncertainty about paying rent or whether they would ever have customers coming back. To help the local community I and with the help of Nyah Way, Alice Zhang, Mayhidya Wazir, and Wilson Mak  have decided to create an easy fun way for restaurants to grow their clientell. Easy Rewards is aimed at connecting restaurants and customers directly through incentives. Through our Easy Rewards app, whether it is a big or small, experienced or new restaurant, you can easily get started with a customer's reward system. The app easy allows for you to create extensively customizable achievements like buy 5 drinks, get 1 free. In addition it offers critical statistics to track customer progress and you will be able to visually see as your restaurant grows bigger.
