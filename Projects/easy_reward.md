COVID-19 has hit a lot of restaurants with uncertainty about paying rent or whether they would ever have customers coming back. To help the local community, my team and I (composed of Nyah Way, Alice Zhang, Mayhidya Wazir, and Wilson Mak) decided to create an easy and fun way for restaurants to grow their clientele. Easy Rewards is aimed at connecting restaurants and customers directly through incentives. Through our app, whether the restaurant is big or small, experienced or newer, they can easily get started with a customer reward system. The app Easy Rewards allows for restaurants to create customizable achievements like "buy 5 dim sum specials, get 10% off your order". In addition, it offers critical statistics to track customer progress and how customers are interacting with your rewards and content.

This video shows a demo of our app and will soon be released on the iOS and Google app store.

The app is made using the Quasar Framework, working directly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also rely on Firebase for user validation and database management.
