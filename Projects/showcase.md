Showcase is an app designed to create a space for people in the film industry to connect and network. Currently
most actors are forced to use unprofessional networking tools like Instagram, resort to high prices on 
casting sites, or to conduct networking physically. Sites like Linkedin fail to meet the needs of actors
and others in the film industry due to the lack of tools for actors to show their skills and achievements.
