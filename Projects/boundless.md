Boundless is a collection of mini-games offered to Android devices. It was made using Java and Android Studio. It’s made with the collective contribution of Nyah Way, Jenna Chen, Cynthia Song, Pannah Yazdanmehr, and Huiqin Chen. It features 3 separate mini-games with a statistics feature and a shop where you can buy items to help you in your game. Boundless currently features a GPA catcher game, where you as the student must run back and forth catching assignments and time extensions, while avoiding the bombs all of which are falling from the sky. It’s a race against the time to get a 4.0 GPA by catching as many assignments as you can. The second mini-game is a pixel game, where players must correctly color in a grid to discover the hidden image given a set of clues using their logic and deductive skills. The last one is a rotating tiles mini-game, where you must rotate the orientations of the tiles so a path of pipes is created, connecting the start to the finish.
